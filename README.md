# Eigenvectors of Metabolic Networks and Gene Expression Proﬁles: Smoothness and Correlation

I implement a workﬂow to quantitatively assess smoothness of a colored graph and check the correlation between eigenvectors of a metabolic network and gene expression proﬁles. Rapaport et al. use gene network information as a priori to gene expression profoile analysis. This project expand previous work by quantifying the smoothness of a colored graph and checking correlation between eigenvectors of the metabolic network and gene expression proﬁles. The workﬂow of the experiment includes data preprocessing, plotting metabolic network, quantifying smoothness, compute correlation coefﬁcients. Finally, a conclusion about these two points are drawn and some future work is discussed.
