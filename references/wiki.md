## Terminology

* transcription:
  process in which DNA is transcribed to RNA
  
* **Gene regulatory networks**:
 (GRNs, also known as **transcriptional regulatory networks**) are networks of causal interactions among transcription factors and downstream genes, and are usually represented with **directed graphs** and inferred by **gene expression data**. -- [Network Inference and Reconstruction in Bioinformatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338202902)

* microarray:
  a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface.
  
  * application in [gene expression profiling](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DNA_microarray#/Uses_and_types)
  
* gene expression profiling:
  In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement of the activity (the expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global picture of cellular function.
  
* pathway:

* RegulonDB:
  RegulonDB is the primary database **on** transcriptional regulation **in** *[Escherichia coli](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Escherichia_coli_in_molecular_biology)* (大肠杆菌) K-12 **containing** knowledge manually curated from original scientific publications, **complemented** with high throughput datasets and comprehensive computational predictions.
  
* phenotype:
  the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.
